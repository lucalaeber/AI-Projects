AI-Projects

A collection of classical Artificial Intelligence projects showcasing search, constraint satisfaction, and probabilistic reasoning techniques.

⸻

📌 Overview

This repository brings together several core AI assignments completed as part of the Artificial Intelligence Principles & Techniques (AIPT) course at Radboud University.
Each project is organized in its own folder and includes code, documentation, and assignment write-ups.

These projects demonstrate essential AI concepts such as:
	
  •	Adversarial search
	
  •	Heuristic evaluation
	
  •	Constraint satisfaction & inference
	
  •	Backtracking search
	
  •	Probabilistic reasoning
	
  •	Bayesian network inference

Together, they form a strong foundation in classical AI problem-solving.
